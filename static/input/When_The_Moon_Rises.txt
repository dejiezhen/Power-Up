But when the moon rises, it begins to work
Its strange automation
They say that soon after the war
A factory workerâ€™s hair got tangled
In the machines, killing her
There are things that float here
But this is not the work of ghosts
No
In the factory
There are peculiar habits
That is what I mean
Peculiar habits remain here
