### Power Up

Motivation: I decided to make this project because I felt like asian history and asian voices are never heard in America. Before COVID, no one really understood the asian American experience and schools never studied our history. Asians are often viewed as the model minority and that we are next in line to becoming “white” so people assume we do not get discriminated. With that societal image of Asian americans, and the fact that we do not have enough power voices to speak up about our experience, society continues to discriminate. Especially with COVID, hatred against asian americans rose. There are multiple instances of attacks against asians and even video of attacks against grandpas. It is because we spoke up now, more than ever that we all begin learning more about the asian American experience. For this project, I decided to use speech recognition to mimic the idea of speaking up. The data from speech recognition would be used as a prompt to generate a poem.
